This *notebook* aims to make a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for **Kanji Classification** using the **Triplet Loss**.  
The goal is to create **embeddings** of Kanji drawings, which can then be compared with reference images using **cosine similarity** to perform classification.

You can install the dependencies required for this notebook from the *requirements.txt* file.

**Warning** : I can't provide the datasets used for this project here. More information about them is available directly in the notebook.
